        <h2>Why Keep an ELSA Journal?</h2>

        <h3>An ELSA journal is like version control for your ethical reasoning.</h3>

        <p>
            It adds structure and traceability to a process that’s otherwise invisible — enabling smarter decisions,
            easier collaboration, and more robust, responsible systems.
        </p>

        <h3>An ELSA journal supports rigorous, transparent workflows</h3>

        <p>
            Just like a lab notebook in experimental science, an ELSA journal captures the decision-making process,
            including what was considered, what was chosen, and why.
        </p>

        <p>
            This supports:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Reproducibility:</b> Others (or your future self) can trace ethical and societal reasoning.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Transparency:</b> Your rationale for handling fairness, privacy, or bias is documented, not buried in
                memory or Slack threads.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>An ELSA journal helps to simplify compliance requirements and reviews</h3>

        <p>Many data projects now fall under regulatory scrutiny (e.g. GDPR, AI Act, public procurement policies).</p>

        <p>The journal:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Acts as an audit trail for legal or ethical review.
            </li>
            <li>
                Helps justify decisions made under uncertainty (e.g. why a certain dataset was excluded, or why a
                particular fairness metric was used).
            </li>
            <li>
                Makes it easier to write final impact assessments, ethics summaries, or model documentation.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>An ELSA journal encourages iterative reflection and course-correction</h3>

        <p>Keeping track of ELSA-related concerns allows teams to:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Spot inconsistencies or blind spots early in the workflow.
            </li>
            <li>
                Reflect on trade-offs (e.g., accuracy vs. fairness, complexity vs. explainability).
            </li>
            <li>
                Capture insights that can feed into model or data revisions down the line.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>An ELSA journal can help to improve cross-disciplinary collaboration</h3>

        <p>For projects involving ethicists, legal experts, social scientists, or impacted stakeholders:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                The journal creates a shared reference point for discussions.
            </li>
            <li>
                It helps translate technical choices into accessible justifications for non-technical audiences.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>An ELSA journal contributes to institutional learning and best practices</h3>

        <p>Over time, a library of journal entries across projects:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>
                Becomes a living archive of lessons learned.
            </li>
            <li>
                Reveals recurring ethical bottlenecks or high-risk points in the pipeline.
            </li>
            <li>
                Helps build internal guidelines or even training materials based on real experience.
            </li>
        </ol>
